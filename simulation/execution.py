"""Trade execution engine used by the simulator.

The strategies place orders into a :class:`Portfolio` instance.  On each trading
day the simulator calls :func:`execute_orders` which walks through the pending
orders and executes those whose conditions are met.  The design is intentionally
minimal â€“ it does not attempt to model a full exchange but instead applies a
simple fixed bid/ask spread and supports a handful of order types relevant to
the built-in strategies.

    """Evaluate and execute any pending orders for the given day.

    Parameters
    ----------
    current_price:
        The market price of the asset on the current day.
    portfolio:
        :class:`Portfolio` holding cash, shares and pending orders.
    day_index:
        Integer index of the current simulation day (used by some strategies for
        timing).  Orders carry their placement day so we can compute how long
        they have been outstanding.

    The function mutates ``portfolio`` in place by adjusting cash/share balances
    and removing orders that were executed.

    Notes
    -----
    ``portfolio.spread`` represents the total bid/ask spread as a percentage
    (e.g. ``1`` for a 1% spread).  The execution price uses half the spread on
    each side:

    * Buy orders pay ``current_price * (1 + spread/200)``
    * Sell orders receive ``current_price * (1 - spread/200)``
